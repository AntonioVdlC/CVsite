I chose computer science because it is everywhere and this choice does not limit me and gives me the possibility to work on anything from anywhere!</p><ul id="about-education" class="about-container"><li id="about-education-efrei"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/education/efrei.png"><span>EFREI Engineering Institute</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">M.Sc. in Computer Engineering</p><p class="about-container-content">After 5 years of studying I obtained my Master's of Science in Computer Engineering with Honours in 2013! Besides solid skills in computer science, mathematics and management, I also had the opportunity to lead the international club for a year and to spend 2 semesters abroad!</p></li><li id="about-education-ntu"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/education/ntu.png"><span>Nanyang Technological University</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Exchange Semester</p><p class="about-container-content">I loved every single second of my time in Singapore studying at NTU! I studied Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Embedded Systems and Organisational Leadership. This semester was the highlight of my student life and a great opening into Asian culture as a whole.</p></li><li id="about-education-upem"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/education/upem.png"><span>Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science</p><p class="about-container-content">While pursuing my engineering degree at EFREI, I obtained a Bachelor of Science with Honours from a partner university. I never put a feet in there, and I would have trouble locating it on a map, but I still somehow hold a diploma from there. It was actually useful for my exchange in Singapore as I could them take Master's level classes!</p></li><li id="about-education-sjsu"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/education/sjsu.png"><span>San Jose State University</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Exchange Semester</p><p class="about-container-content">During my time in San Jose, I studied the likes of OS, Cody Theory, Networks and Entrepreneurship and visited a few companies in the area. It was also a first interesting glimpse into American culture and into the Bay Area. My favorite part was visiting Lake Tahoe and realising that there is more to California than sun and beaches!</p></li><li id="about-education-lfb"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/education/lfb.png"><span>Lycée Français Jean-Monnet</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">French Baccalaureate in Sciences</p><p class="about-container-content">I attended a French international school for my secondary education in Brussels after spending my early years in Africa.

My role as a software engineer was to build a new API-based codebase from the legacy monolithic app and to add new features along the way. I also championned new software development processes such as a branch-based version control workflow, specs and a test strategy.</p></li><li id="about-experience-structis-2"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/experience/structis.png"><span>Mobile Applications R&amp;D Engineer</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Bouygues Construction - Structis</p><p class="about-container-content">Working withing the R&amp;D department of Structis was a great experience! For 6 months, I was given almost complete freedom to experiment and build hybrid mobile apps based on the company's internal software and mobile strategy. I designed an enterprise appstore, maintained and developped new versions of the company's directory app and developped a mobile version of the company's document management tool.</p></li><li id="about-experience-structis-1"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/experience/structis.png"><span>Windows Sidebar Gadgets Developer</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Bouygues Construction - Structis</p><p class="about-container-content">My first real experience in a real job was during my summer internship in 2012. At Structis, within the R&amp;D department, I was in charge of studying the different ways Windows sidebar gadgets could be used within the company. I also wrote a 55-page development guide and crafted 14 production-ready prototypes. All that in only 14 weeks!</p></li><li id="about-experience-efrei-int"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/experience/efrei-int.png"><span>President</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">EFREI International</p><p class="about-container-content">This is probably the position I am the proudest of, even though it has nothing to do with computers or it being an actual job. After 2 years of active involvement in the international club at EFREI, I step up and became president for a year, welcoming more than 80 international students and managing a 40-people team and almost $10k of financing.</p></li><li id="about-experience-ecole-louvre"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/experience/ecole-louvre.png"><span>Intern</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Bibliothèque de l'Ecole du Louvre</p><p class="about-container-content">During the month of July 2009, I was working, alongside some of my classmates, at the Library of the Ecole du Louvre. It was a physical and repetitive work (moving books around, doing the inventory and scanning exams), but it was still an interesting and rewarding experience. I got to see the Mona Lisa almost every day!</p></li></ul><ul id="about-interests" class="about-container"><li id="about-interests-travel"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/interests/travel.png"><span>Travel</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">25+ countries ... and counting!</p><p class="about-container-content">Travelling has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. Growing up in Africa, then living in Europe for almost a decade and then taking a year to travel the world has been an incredibly enriching experience and I hope I can continue enriching myself and the people I meet throughout my next adventures!</p></li><li id="about-interests-cycling"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/interests/cycling.png"><span>Road Cycling</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Because those guys are just heroes!</p><p class="about-container-content">The first time I watched a stage of the Tour de France on TV, I didn't really get it ... A breakaway? A peloton? 5 minutes ahead? Road cycling is a very interesting sport as it is a team sport with individual ranking. It is more tactical than it may seem and it's really about going 100% at the right time. I also like riding bikes, and I plan on investing more of my time cycling around!</p></li><li id="about-interests-guitar"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/interests/guitar.png"><span>Guitar</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Rock 'n' Roll</p><p class="about-container-content">I started playing the guitar out of boredom one summer once in college, and I ended up playing it for a couple of years regularly until I put my electric guitar aside. I am still an avid rock music fan and like to play a few chords here and there, but I definitely need to pick up my guitar more often!</p></li><li id="about-interests-vexillology"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/interests/vexillology.png"><span>Vexillology</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Vexillolo ... what?</p><p class="about-container-content">I remember the day we got our first dictionnaries in primary school. I was still in the Ivory Coast, and the first few pages where filled with the flags of all the countries (the last few where maps). I guess I was so bored in class that I went on to learn every country, its capital and its flag! That knowledge has proven more useful than I thought and I love updating my wisdom on each and every country by travelling and experiencing them!</p></li><li id="about-interests-education"><p class="about-container-title"> <img src="img/interests/education.png"><span>Education</span></p><p class="about-container-subtitle">Moving civilisation forward, one book at a time!</p><p class="about-container-content">Maybe it is because I come from a family of teachers, or maybe it is because I have experienced numerous educational systems, but I strongly believe that if we want a better world and a better society, we need a better education for everyone!</p></li></ul></div></body></html>
